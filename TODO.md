## 📋 Known Limitations & Technical Debt

1. **Monte Carlo Engine**: t-CDF approximation is simplified; consider numerical integration
2. **Correlation Structure**: Uses simple Cholesky decomposition; could enhance with DCC-GARCH
3. **Wrong-Way Risk**: Piecewise linear model; consider regime-switching models
4. **VaR Calculations**: Current implementation is parametric; add historical and Monte Carlo VaR
5. **Performance**: Large portfolios (>100 loans) may need optimization
6. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Dashboard optimized for desktop; mobile needs enhancement
