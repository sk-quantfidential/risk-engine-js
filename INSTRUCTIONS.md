## üìä Understanding the Data

### Sample Portfolio Characteristics

**Total Exposure**: $96,000,000
**Risk Capital**: $100,000,000
**Utilization**: 96%

**Collateral Breakdown**:
- BTC: 60% (~$58M)
- ETH: 30% (~$29M)
- SOL: 10% (~$9M)

**Credit Ratings**:
- BBB: 50% (5 loans)
- A: 40% (4 loans)
- AA: 10% (1 loan)

### Margin Policies

| Asset | Warning | Margin Call | Liquidation |
|-------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| BTC   | 70%     | 80%         | 90%         |
| ETH   | 65%     | 75%         | 85%         |
| SOL   | 60%     | 70%         | 80%         |

**Example**: If BTC-backed loan has LTV of 75%, it's in "Warning" status.

---

### Risk Metrics Explained

**LTV (Loan-to-Value)**:
```
LTV = Principal / Collateral Value
```
Higher LTV = more risk

**VaR (Value at Risk)**:
```
95% VaR = Loss at 95th percentile
```
"We're 95% confident we won't lose more than this"

**CVaR (Conditional VaR / Expected Shortfall)**:
```
CVaR = Average loss beyond VaR threshold
```
"If we're in the worst 5%, expect to lose this on average"

**Expected Loss**:
```
EL = Principal √ó PD √ó LGD
```
"Expected loss over 1 year"

**Sharpe Ratio**:
```
Sharpe = (Return - SOFR) / Volatility
```
Higher = better risk-adjusted return

## üß™ Things to Try

### Experiment 1: Correlation Impact
1. Go to `/dashboard/correlations`
2. Note baseline VaR (should be ~$625K)
3. Set all correlations to 1.0 (perfect correlation)
4. See VaR increase to ~$830K (+33%)
5. Set all correlations to 0.0 (uncorrelated)
6. See VaR decrease to ~$470K (-25%)

**Lesson**: Diversification reduces tail risk

---

### Experiment 2: Scenario Stress Test
1. Go to `/dashboard/scenarios`
2. Select "Stable Growth" (baseline)
3. Note expected loss (~$250K)
4. Add "2020 COVID Crash"
5. See expected loss jump to ~$1.8M (7x increase)
6. See aggregate LTV jump from 65% to 95%

**Lesson**: Extreme scenarios cause severe stress

---

### Experiment 3: Real-Time Risk
1. Go to `/dashboard` (Portfolio Overview)
2. Click "START LIVE"
3. Watch loan LOAN-005 (Crypto Trading Group)
4. This loan has 3.5x leverage (highest risk)
5. Notice LTV fluctuating around 87%
6. It's close to 90% liquidation threshold

**Lesson**: High leverage loans need close monitoring

---

### Experiment 4: Optimization
1. Go to `/dashboard/optimization`
2. Find LOAN-005 (Crypto Trading Group)
3. See it contributes 18% of portfolio risk
4. Revenue per risk ratio: 1.2 (below threshold)
5. Recommendation: "REDUCE"
6. Compare to LOAN-008 (Prime Digital Assets)
7. Contributes only 4% of risk
8. Revenue per risk ratio: 3.8 (excellent)
9. Recommendation: "INCREASE"

**Lesson**: Optimize by reducing high-risk/low-revenue loans
