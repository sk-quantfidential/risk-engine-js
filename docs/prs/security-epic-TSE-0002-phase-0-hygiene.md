# PR: Security Epic TSE-0002 — Phase 0 (Hygiene)

**Epic**: epic-TSE-0002 (Security Audit)
**Phase**: Phase 0 - Hygiene

## Summary

- Establishes baseline security hygiene and repo policies to support a CISO-grade audit program.
- Improves .gitignore to prevent leakage of environment files, caches, and logs.
- Adds CODEOWNERS and Dependabot for supply-chain hygiene and change control.
- Introduces the overarching Security Audit Plan document.

## What Changed

### .gitignore

- Added ignore patterns for `.env*`, `.next/cache/`, `.turbo/`, and common `*.log` files.

### .github/CODEOWNERS

- Default ownership `@your-org/maintainers` with example scoped ownership for `infra/` and `docs/`.

### .github/dependabot.yml

- Weekly npm dependency update PRs; labeled `dependencies` and `security`.

### docs/SECURITY_AUDIT_PLAN.md

- Ten-phase plan: Hygiene → SBOM → SAST → Secrets → SCA → Backdoor Recon → IaC → Runtime Hardening → Behavior Tests → Threat Modeling/Report.

## Rationale

- Prevent accidental check-in of secrets/artifacts.
- Ensure owners review changes; enable automated dependency updates for CVEs.
- Aligns repo with repeatable, evidence-based audit workflow.

## Risk/Impact

- None (documentation + ignore rules only). No runtime behavior changes.

## Testing

### Validation Tests

- [x] Run `git status` to verify env/log/cache files are untracked as intended
- [x] Verify Dependabot configuration validates in GitHub repo settings
- [x] Confirm CODEOWNERS file syntax is valid
- [x] Verify .gitignore patterns prevent sensitive files from being committed

### Security Verification

- [x] Test .gitignore patterns with sample .env files
- [x] Verify SECURITY_AUDIT_PLAN.md is complete and actionable
- [x] Confirm all Phase 0 hygiene tasks completed

## Follow-ups (Phase 1)

- SBOM generation (Syft) and vulnerability scan (Grype) in CI; upload artifacts and checksums.
- Document SBOM handling and verification procedures.
