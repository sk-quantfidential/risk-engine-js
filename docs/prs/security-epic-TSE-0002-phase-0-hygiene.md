# PR: Security Epic TSE-0002 — Phase 0 (Hygiene)

Summary
- Establishes baseline security hygiene and repo policies to support a CISO-grade audit program.
- Improves .gitignore to prevent leakage of environment files, caches, and logs.
- Adds CODEOWNERS and Dependabot for supply-chain hygiene and change control.
- Introduces the overarching Security Audit Plan document.

Scope of Changes
- .gitignore
  - Added ignore patterns for `.env*`, `.next/cache/`, `.turbo/`, and common `*.log` files.
- .github/CODEOWNERS
  - Default ownership `@your-org/maintainers` with example scoped ownership for `infra/` and `docs/`.
- .github/dependabot.yml
  - Weekly npm dependency update PRs; labeled `dependencies` and `security`.
- docs/SECURITY_AUDIT_PLAN.md
  - Ten-phase plan: Hygiene → SBOM → SAST → Secrets → SCA → Backdoor Recon → IaC → Runtime Hardening → Behavior Tests → Threat Modeling/Report.

Rationale
- Prevent accidental check-in of secrets/artifacts.
- Ensure owners review changes; enable automated dependency updates for CVEs.
- Aligns repo with repeatable, evidence-based audit workflow.

Risk/Impact
- None (documentation + ignore rules only). No runtime behavior changes.

Validation
- `git status` shows env/log/cache files untracked as intended.
- Dependabot configuration validates in GitHub repo settings.

Follow-ups (Phase 1)
- SBOM generation (Syft) and vulnerability scan (Grype) in CI; upload artifacts and checksums.
- Document SBOM handling and verification procedures.
